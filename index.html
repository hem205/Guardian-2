    <h2>Lore of the Guardian</h2>
    <p>The Guardian is a Pinionfolk warrior. He was charged with the protection of the flock. After tragedy strikes, he makes his way to the Roundtable Hold to put an end to the terror of the nightlords.</p>

    <h2>Guardian's Gameplay</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Guardian's primary role is to tank for the party.</li>
        <li>His passive ability allows the player to enter an alternate guard stance that helps conserve stamina while blocking.</li>
        <li>His character skill creates a whirlwind AOE that can easily stagger smaller enemies and give the party room to breathe. This skill can be charged to increase its AOE.</li>
        <li>Guardian's ultimate art is a high-flying divebomb that deals good damage and can revive downed party members in one fell swoop. Holding R2 after Guardian lands deploys a defensive barrier AOE that negates damage to anyone within, including Guardian himself, allowing teammates to safely heal and regroup. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Optimizing Party Composition with Guardian</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Guardian plays nicely with most of the Elden Ring Nightreign roster.</li>
        <li>Squishier characters who generally operate at range, including <a href="https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Recluse" target="_blank">Recluse</a>, <a href="https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Revenant" target="_blank">Revenant</a>, and <a href="./ironeye.html">Ironeye</a>, benefit from his ability to draw aggro off of them.</li>
        <li>Guardian isn't well positioned to deal high DPS, so characters like <a href="https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Wylder" target="_blank">Wylder</a>, <a href="https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Duchess" target="_blank">Duchess</a>, and <a href="https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Executor" target="_blank">Executor</a> are good to have in the mix to focus on damage dealing alongside one of the aforementioned ranged characters.</li>
        <li>Finally, while not an outright bad choice, a party consisting of both a <a href="https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Raider" target="_blank">Raider</a> and a Guardian might find those two characters filling redundant rolls. Raider is similarly tanky, and his character skill encourages a playstyle that draws aggro to absorb big hits, so a party with both may find their DPS lacking. Raider is a more flexible character, so a party committed to employing both characters should encourage their Raider to focus more on damage dealing and capitalizing on critical hits.</li>
    </ul>
